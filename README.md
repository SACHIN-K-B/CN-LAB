# PART-B: Simulation Experiments using NS2/ NS3/ NetSim or any other suitable simulation software.
<br>
10 a. Implement three n
9.Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex 
links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find 
the number of packets dropped<br>
b. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a 
network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets 
dropped due to congestion
<br><br>
10.a. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic 
nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.<br>
b. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less 
LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to 
transmission of packets
<br><br>
11.a. Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2/NS3 
(Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment<br>
b. Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2/NS3 
(Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment.
